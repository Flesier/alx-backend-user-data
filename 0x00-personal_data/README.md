## Introduction

Personal data includes any information related to an identified or identifiable individual. It can be as simple as a name and email address or more sensitive data like financial records or biometric information. Handling personal data responsibly is essential to protect individuals' privacy and maintain trust.

This repository provides guidelines and code examples to help developers implement secure data handling practices in their Python applications. We address data protection, encryption, access control, storage, deletion, and auditing.

## Types of Personal Data

We discuss different types of personal data that developers may encounter, along with their respective security considerations. Understanding the types of personal data is crucial for implementing the appropriate security measures.

## Data Protection

Learn about data protection principles and techniques to safeguard personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We cover data masking, access control, and best practices to protect sensitive data.

## Pseudonymization and Anonymization

Explore the concepts of pseudonymization and anonymization to enhance data privacy and comply with data protection regulations. Learn how to pseudonymize and anonymize personal data to reduce the risk of re-identification.

## Data Encryption

Data encryption is a crucial component of securing personal data. Discover various encryption methods and how to encrypt data using Python to prevent unauthorized access.

## Data Access Control

Controlling access to personal data is vital to limit data exposure. Understand access control mechanisms and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information.

## Secure Data Storage

We discuss secure data storage techniques, including secure databases, encrypted file storage, and protecting data at rest. Ensure that your personal data is stored securely to prevent data breaches.

## Data Deletion and Retention

Learn about data deletion and retention policies to comply with data protection regulations. Implement proper data deletion procedures to remove personal data when it's no longer needed.

## Data Auditing and Logging

Implement data auditing and logging to keep track of data access and changes. Auditing helps with data accountability and identifying potential security incidents.

## Usage and Examples

This section provides code examples and tutorials on how to implement the discussed data handling practices in Python. It includes sample scripts and explanations to guide you through the process.
